npx expo login
```

### 4. Initialize EAS build if not done
```bash
eas init
```

**if eas.json not created then create it manually and paste the below code inside:**

```json
{
  "build": {
    "preview": {
      "android": {
        "buildType": "apk"
      }
    },
    "production": {

      }
    }
  }
}
```

### 5. Start building the APK
```bash
eas build -p android --profile preview
```

**During build, it will ask for Android application ID:**


***Example: com.yourname.watchspot***

**After successful build, you will get an APK download link in the terminal**


***You can also view and download it from your Expo dashboard: https://expo.dev/accounts***
